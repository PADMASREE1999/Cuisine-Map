# Cuisine-Map
An Android Mobile App used to learn about the recipe and locations of famous cuisines in a area.

Food plays a crucial role in understanding a place. Different flavours and textures speak volumes about the habits and lifestyle of the locals. Our project involves an app that focuses on the local cuisines of a selected place. The app provides user with details of some most popular and traditional must have dishes from a place. It gives details about the dish and its specialities. 
The user can choose a city they are visiting and the app will show the famous and must try dishes to the user. Once the user chooses a dish, there will be three modules â€“
Recipe: This tab will provide the user with the ingredients and the recipe on how to prepare the food. This will help the user understand the process and check for any allergies.
Nutritional Benefits: This tab will help the user in understanding the benefits of a certain dish.
Restaurants: This will lead the user to information about the restaurants that serve the dish along with their prices and ratings.
